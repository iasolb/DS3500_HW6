Identify what you consider to be your “best” solution and justify your answer!

🏆 Best Solution:
   Aggregate Score: 0.03
   Conflicts: 0 | Unavailable: 0
   Overalloc: 0 | Undersupport: 0 | Unpreferred: 3

We believe that this is the best choice because it perfectly satisfies all hard constraints with zero conflicts, zero
unavailable assignments, zero overallocation, and zero undersupport. This means every section is properly staffed, no
TA is double-booked or overworked, and all assignments respect TA availability. The only trade-off is 3 unpreferred
assignments, where TAs are assigned to sections they marked as "willing" rather than "preferred"—a minor inconvenience
that doesn't compromise operational requirements. In contrast, the other solutions have undersupport or overallocation
issues that directly impact instruction quality and TA wellbeing, making them inferior choices despite having fewer
unpreferred assignments.
