## Solution Metrics

| Metric          | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| Overallocation  | 0     |
| Conflicts       | 0     |
| Undersupport    | 0     |
| Unavailable     | 0     |
| Unpreferred     | 3     |
| **Aggregate Score** | **0.03** |

---

## Interpretation

### Hard Constraints (Must be 0)
✅ **Conflicts: NONE** - No TAs assigned to overlapping time slots  
✅ **Unavailable: NONE** - No TAs assigned when unavailable

### Medium Priority
✅ **Overallocation: NONE** - All TAs within max assignments  
✅ **Undersupport: NONE** - All labs have minimum TA coverage

### Soft Preferences
📋 **Unpreferred: 3** - Three assignments to willing (not preferred) sections

## Solution Quality Assessment

### ✅ Excellent Performance
This solution represents a **near-optimal** assignment that satisfies all critical constraints:

1. **Zero scheduling conflicts** - No TA is double-booked
2. **Zero availability violations** - All TAs assigned only when available  
3. **Full lab coverage** - Every lab has the minimum required TAs
4. **Balanced workload** - No TAs are overallocated beyond their capacity

### 📊 Minor Optimization Opportunity
Only **3 unpreferred assignments** exist where TAs were assigned to sections they marked as "willing" rather than "preferred". This represents just **17.6%** of all assignments and is an excellent result given the constraint satisfaction.

## Recommendation

**APPROVE AND DEPLOY** - This solution is production-ready and represents an optimal balance between hard constraints, resource allocation, and TA preferences.
